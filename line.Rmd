This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
LINE_embedding <- read.csv("../../../data/embedding/indexed_GM12878_line_embedding_HiC_graph_order_3_samples_25M.embedding", sep = "\t", header= FALSE)
LINE_segway_annotation <- read.csv("../../../data/annotations/segway_LINE.bed", sep = "\t", header = FALSE)
get_compartment <- function(chr, pos){
  a = LINE_segway_annotation[LINE_segway_annotation$V1==chr & LINE_segway_annotation$V2 < pos & LINE_segway_annotation$V3 >= pos,4]
  #print(a)
  return(a)
}
LINE_embedding$V1 = as.character(LINE_embedding$V1)
LINE_segway_annotation$V1 = as.character(LINE_segway_annotation$V1)
LINE_embedding$compartment = mapply(get_compartment, LINE_embedding$V1,
                                    LINE_embedding$V2)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(LINE_embedding) + geom_point(aes(x = V3, y = V4, color = compartment))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
